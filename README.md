# BlackHole-AccretionDisk-Simulation
A accretion disk simulation of a black holes accretion disk and its visualization.
This project generates a realistic, artistic simulation of a black hole similar to the famous image of M87* captured by the Event Horizon Telescope. Using Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib, it recreates the glowing accretion disk, gravitational lensing, relativistic beaming, and radio fuzziness.

Every time you run the script, the result is unique thanks to randomized parameters simulating the natural turbulence and dynamic effects of real astrophysical black holes.
